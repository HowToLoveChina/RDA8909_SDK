/* This file describes the uncached content of the internal SRAM used by object
   place into the internal ROM.
   This content is used twice:
   - in granite_internal_rom_master.ld, to produce the ROM file
   - in granite_master.ld, to place what is located in ROM but not
   burnt with the FPGA.
   One subtlety is that the ALIGN keyword is forbidden in the
   DISCARD section, as are the symbol definition. Thus we play with the ROM_BUILD
   flag to include those linker script command only in the rom building
   script.
*/

/* Other macros are used, to specifically detail the content of the
   ROM according to its fate: the real chip or a FPGA, where it is
   faster to copy the ROM content during the program execution,
   often needed due to the under dev state of the code.
   We discriminate thus 2 parts:
    - a mandatory one (ROM_MANDATORY_PART) needed to boot and
    containing codes and object which shouldn't change.
    - an optional part (ROM_OPTIONAL_PART) (as in optionally
    in the ROM before booting), not needed to boot and containing
    code under heavy development and subject to fast pace changes.
    (faster than the fpga release scale).
    We need to discard, in the software build, the content of
    what already in ROM. We use those flags in that case too.
